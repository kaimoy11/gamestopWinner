Their initial gimmick was $0 commissions on trades, but you can get that at firms like Fidelity and Schwab now, which you should use over RH for a couple of reasons. 1) execution quality on your trades. RH makes money by taking your order and selling it to the order room that promises to pay them the most for it. This means it takes longer for your trade to fill, costing you money potentially. 2) additional coverage for your assets. In addition to SIPC insurance, bigger firms give you additional insurance. Fidelity uses Lloyds of London. You get way more than $250k in cash and additional $250k in securities this way. Plus they’ve been around for decades, are reputable, and house trillions in assets. They aren’t going to potentially sweat someone suddenly cashing out 6 million. RH? Who fucking knows man.

By positioning the business to cater for the most demanding consumer class in the sector and connecting with them at a deep level can GameStop really elevate its brand to be the first option in the remaining mass market. Honestly, as a shareholder, I’m quite happy to see the Sherminator continue in the company - that dude has done a great job at optimizing the B&M operation. With him focused on that and RC’s guys on building the e-commerce ops, marketing and customer service, it has all the ingredients to be the top player in the sector. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some M&A activity within the next 12 - 18 months to accelerate the entrance in this segment (particularly looking at Enthusiast Gaming - EGLX - that has over 1bn monthly active users, esports teams and a network of esport media platforms, would be the perfect fit to GameStop).\n",

There are a lot of technical limitations, as well as a real need to make deals with online videogame marketplaces like Steam, GOG, Epic Games... that allow games to be cross transferable between them.

      "There has been cases tried in court (at least in France) to let consumers sell their digital games on a digital market, and Steam is actively fighting this. They don't do buybacks either. I can only assume that they have done some calculations and found it less profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, a secondhand market of digital games will hurt the developers so much that they have no real incentive to sign with GME. \n",
      "Any developer would still earn more from dumping their prices of a AAA game from $70 to $10 on an existing game store, than by letting GME sell a game seconhand ($0). And gamecards are only so profitable and lucrative to buy online someplace else than at your preferred digital game store where you get more value for your money (because GME isn't taking a cut).\n",
      "\n",
      "If we then assume they establish this digital market:\n",
      "GME has always made most of their money on scam-like practices, buying or trading games for a fraction of their value and selling games way overpriced to clueless grandmas. \n",
      "Money saved has mostly been on employees with no other options and accept less than minimum wage. On a digital platform you have less employee costs, but those employees you do have needs to be specialized.\n",
      "On the earning side, you have to compete on the interweb where the price comparisons jump in your face at your first google search. Assuming your average clueless grandma gets even that far.\n",
      "Gamestop having to compete on price is so far out of their comfort zone, not to mention capabilities, that it's hard to even imagine it working. \n",

      "\n",

      "958 0.993 Right now console games are more or less the same price digital and physical. In fact, most of the times you can find deals in stores for physical games, but for digital you only have Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo as the seller (I know some webpages sell keys but they normally come from bundles that include a key for a game, no disc, and MS has started to not give you a key but rather have the game already linked to the console you bought, to avoid the online resell) so they sell at the price they want to sell and make way more profit than in physical, as they are cutting down the middle man, distribution, manufacturing, etc. And, the point of this discussion, the digital games cannot be traded-in or sold to another person.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the benefits of digital (apart from environmental which is good on itself) for the costumer are just the convenience of not having to move their ass to a store, not having to swap disks when they want to change games and the possibility of sharing their digital games with other people (this is somewhat complex and requires confidence between parties, you basically link the account where the game is bought with 2 different consoles, one which is the console where said account is normally logged in and another one which is the receiver of the share. This way both accounts have access to the same license of this game). Microsoft and Sony probably know that people share the digital licenses by this method, but allow it because they rather have players buy digital than physical (hence why they pushed it with the new consoles).\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest point against digital that I read in online forums is that you cannot trade the games, neither with a store or another player. I have no problems imagining MS and Sony (Nintendo's policies are retarded) banning this license sharing but allowing for trades with stores and maybe with other players. This may reduce their current profit on digital sales as the sharing method is somewhat complicated and I'd say most people don't do it but it'd allow them to push harder for digital gaming which is what they want. In the end, more people going digital = more profit, both from having most of their games sold digitally and also (and this is a stretch) they can stop manufacturing consoles with disk readers but keep the price of the consoles as if they had the disk reader.\n",

Chewy was sold 5 years later to PetSmart but started 1 year earlier so before Amazon could create a sound foothold (i.e. Amazon Pantry) Chewy was already 3 or 4 years old and had it's brand established.

Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.  \n",

Is it possible to successfully trade on a single strategy/mantra such as speculative or is it vital to also learn the other strategies?

      "\n",
      "✅ - Create a Fidelity brokerage account or a brokerage account with a platform that did not block or restrict trading. \n",
      "\n",
      "✅ - Authorize an account to deposit money into Fidelity. Fidelity offers up to $25,000 in instant deposit credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ - Withdraw any money currently not invested but deposited into Robinhood & other Brokerages restricting trading. \n",
      "\n",
      "✅ - HOOOOLLLDDD your Robinhood AMC & GME stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ - Setup live market pricing on Fidelity. In the app, go to More... ► Settings and Profile ► Quick Access ► Turn on Watch Lists & Real Time Quotes. This feature is turned off by default and means Fidelity has a 15 minute delay on live ticker prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ - Activate “Extended Hours Trading”. This allows you to trade on the markets before and after close for a set amount of extended time. To do so, you HAVE to be on the Fidelity website. Search in the top right hand search corner “Extended Hours Trading” and pick the article titled exactly that. Walk through the process to enable it. Others are saying to call Fidelity. Don’t. Customer service simply walks you through how to do it on your own from the Fidelity website. \n",
      "\n",
      "✅ - Rate Robinhood a 1-2 on the app and playstore. \n",
      "\n",
      "✅ - Rate Fidelity a 3 or 4 on the app and playstore. 5 star customer service but they deliver a 2 star experience on their god awful UI. Let’s do this to help convince Fidelity to modernize their brokerage app platform & leave Robinhood in the dust. \n",
      "\n",
      "✅ File complaints on Robinhood using SEC - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Class Action Lawsuits - If you believe you were negatively impacted by Robinhoods actions and believe you are entitled to compensation. Begin browsing r/ClassActionRobinhood for further information. Only sign up for the class action you believe has the strongest case. Don’t sign up immediately either. Allow the legal firms to continue developing their cases before determining the strongest.\n",

For a normal, non-GME levels of volatility stock like AAPL, this deposit requirement is ~1-3% of the trade value. So if you put in a trade to buy $10,000 worth of AAPL, your brokerage has to put up $100-$300 in cash until the trade clears. They can't use your cash to do it, they have to use their own cash for it. \n",

But more importantly, they would ALSO be required to put up 100% of the trade value for their customers' SELL orders also. They didn't have the money to pay for both buy & sell orders from their customers, so to prevent getting into a situation where they ran out of deposit $ and couldn't clear ANY orders for their customers, so their customers are trying to sell their GME/other stocks but can't, they restricted buying so they'd have enough money to cover all the sell orders.\n",

      "You mean from the clearing house's perspective ? Why they enforced a 100% deposit requirement on robinhood/other brokers selling GME ? The technical answer is because that's what their formula said it should be. They have a mathematical formula to determine the chances of being \"stuck with the bag\", and they require a deposit based on that chance. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, what they're worried about is if, say, 100,000 robinhood customers bought 10 shares each of GME at $350 on margin, that's $350 million. At the normal 1% deposit, robinhood deposits $3.5 million. Then, the next day, the stock drops to $10 and suddenly all those RH customers don't have the money to make their margin call, so robinhood doesn't have the money to pay the clearinghouse for the shares, and the broker from the other side is demanding their money from the clearinghouse - that's one of the main reasons they exist. To soak up the risk during the T+2 clearing period. An insurance, of sorts, that either side will get their money even if the other side defaults. Because without a clearinghouse, because the NYSE still enforces a T+2 clearing period, when you go to sell a stock to someone, you'd have to make sure they actually had the ability to pay you for those stocks. And there's no one to regulate/force them to actually go through with the trade if, say, they buy your stock at $350, and then during that clearing period the stock price drops to $50, they could (and in the past, did. Back when stocks were actual paper certificates) just tell you to fuck off, they're not paying you, and your only recourse would be to take them to court, which of course comes with it's own issues and puts a significant amount of risk on smaller traders who's trades aren't valuable enough to spend the money involved with suing someone, to enforce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Or similarly, if during that clearing period, the buyer's broker goes bankrupt. The seller's broker will still demand payment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Or potentially worse for the clearinghouse & arguably more likely, the stock gets halted/delisted by the exchange for a week because the exchange suspects significant manipulation on either end, right in the middle of the clearing period. Even though your RH account shows you have those shares in your account, you legally don't. They're still at the clearinghouse, and the clearinghouse is now stuck with those shares they can't transfer but they've already paid the seller's broker for, and that are now potentially worthless, or worth FAR less than they were before the halt, and a big legal battle ensues, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, clearinghouses act somewhat like an insurance company for the buyer & seller - although that's a pretty simplistic way of putting it - because the NYSE still enforces a Trading day + 2 days clearing requirement, for really no good reason. That's why so many companies are pushing for real-time clearing. We absolutely have the technology to do it now. This policy is a relic of a time when stocks were literal paper certificates, so the buyer & seller needed to physically meet up or mail the payment & the stock certificate to each other. Prior to the rule, there was an issue with sellers taking months to send the certificate, etc. so the rule was needed. But obviously that's not a problem anymore. \n",
      "\n",
      "But since there's still that requirement, there's a lot of potential risk involved in the transaction of a trade. The clearinghouse soaks up that risk by guaranteeing both sides of the transaction. So they guarantee to the seller that if the buyer doesn't pay, the clearinghouse will pay them instead, and they guarantee to the buyer that if the seller doesn't turn over the stocks, they'll reimburse the buyer or give the buyer the shares. Then the clearinghouse will deal with the legal battle to be made whole. \n",
      "\n",
      "So just like any other insurance company, as risk (IE: volatility) goes up, so does the insurance premium. In the case of a clearinghouse, as the risk/volatility goes up, so does the deposit requirement. So, when GME started to go \"supernova\", the volatility skyrocketed and in the clearinghouse's eyes, it was very likely that there would be brokerages that defaulted because of liquidity problems. So their raising the deposit requirement on GME to 100% was essentially them taking their ball and going home. Basically, them saying \"we think this stock is so risky, we aren't willing to insure any transactions of this stock. So if you want to sell this stock to your clients or on behalf of your clients, you have to pay for it up front\".\n",

Vlad finally did a decent job of explaining it at the end of the clubhouse interview with Elon Musk. Them restricting buy orders was part of their negotiation with the clearinghouse to reduce the deposit requirement to a level they could afford. \n",

They're committing fraud. They're trying to help out their investors\", etc. instead, Webull's CEO got on national TV and said \"while we're happy to show people there are other options than Robinhood, what happened wasn't robinhood's fault.

However, institutions, in my view, might be reluctant to open long positions when the share price has climbed like 1000% during a couple of weeks. That’s why I feel a larger percentage of buy orders might have come from retail (until buying was halted). Obviously, that’s just pure speculation from my side.\n",

      "Does that about sum it up ? If I'm mistaken somewhere, please tell me. But understanding what I do about the market, the whole idea of a \"short ladder\" hinges entirely on the idea that 2 hedge funds who are both likely short or at least in cahoots together are trading shares back and forth between each other at increasingly lower prices, which doesn't really cost them anything because they're just trading the same shares back and forth, and they make money because it \"tricks the algorithm\" into thinking those aren't the same shares being traded back and forth, but are rather discreet trades, effectively multiplying the volume of shares being traded at a lower price. Which we know is not possible, because the hedge fund cannot target who they sell their shares to.

      "2618 0.8894 Hi, we would know by 3 general reasons:\n",
      "1. r/wallstreetbets would be flooded with GME posts about pre-squeeze, during-squeeze, and post-squeeze (where the tippy top has been identified.) you'd be surprised how deep the WSB tentacles go. It's currently 1.8mm members strong, and many have data on the short stats. \n",
      "2. Short % of tradeable float has not gone down, as in shorts have not covered their positions (as reported by a lot of posts on the subreddit as well).\n",
      "3. Because we have not seen multiple days of deadly upward momentum yet. According to some other posts here, shorts have only doubled down so far, and short interest have gone up. The past few days have been organic growth, as in regular investors bidding the price up high because of genuine interest in the stock, whether for fundamental or technical reasons. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock spiked to $100+ as signifying the first leg of the squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not advice though, research and execute your plan according to your own risk tolerance and where you think it will go. I genuinely think GME will gild a lot of millionaires and likewise bankrupt many, just really depends on which side you're at.\n",
      "2619 -0.765 Hi,\n",
      "I'm still bullish on GME. The upside is just way too big to ignore in my opinion, and it's hard to time when it explodes as there's a lot of factors at play, so I would just buy and hold. I could technically day trade in and out on GME, but the risk of that is I could then miss a lot of potential spikes going up.\n",
      "A lot of put options expired worthless today, and today's price action was probably because of that pressure being lifted. I think at the price where it's at right now is still a good deal.\n",

      "Yea so there's been a lot of posts on GME short data already, and I didn't want to necessarily spam about it even more. Glad to have just started the trend of sharing data to our fellow retard brothers. That said, data from Monday's trading, which is the last we have from ORTEX, indicates that there has been 0 covering that day. SI is over 100% still, which is in line with market consensus on GME short data. Some posts on WSB about it already, some posted S3 data when you Google it, reports all say we're still over >100% since yesterday. The important thing to keep in mind is for us to track the %float shorted, to know roughly where we are in the GME timeline. Also I suggest you try out ORTEX yourself, it has a 7-day trial period. Could be handy esp. while GME is ripping. Lastly, what does that tell us? It means that our zero point might just have started at $200. Insane. Nobody knows how high this goes. \n",

      "\n",
      "Anyway, maybe, maybe not. Not really sure at this point cause our %Tradeable Float shorted is >100%. I honestly have no idea how they can ever cover. However, assuming they can fully cover, then yes, in theory. Since GME is unprecedented, we're not really sure. So even at this point, the potential price target can be blown past through because of so many unknowns. Sorry my response is not very helpful, I'm still amazed at all the recent developments.\n",
      "2624 -0.8481 The interest rates have been spiking up, and it's bleeding the shorts. The way I look at it now, the longer they wait, the hotter the burn. But a short squeeze at this point is almost inevitable, barring these fuckers cheating like they did Thursday. But this has turned global, so there is BIG money on both sides.

      "\n",
      "To be fair, the bear case is easy to make if you don’t dig below the surface.  GME lost a lot of money last year and it’s a mall retailer.  It doesn’t take too much digging to see the balance sheet is solid, the low sales to enterprise value ratio, there’s a turn around plan, the e-commerce was so bad that it’s easy to improve, they have a ton of data that is likely undervalued, the dawn of the console cycle, and RC crossing the 10% threshold.  The MOASS is just a bonus lottery ticket that could pay off big.\n",
      "2873 -0.7845 Wrong. Buying a put with strike above the current price just provides a lot of protection on the downside, much like buying a call with strike price below the current price does. ITM options provide lower risk.\n",
      "2874 0.34 The value of a put contract goes up the more the underlying drops.\n",
      "2875 -0.25 Reduce risk. The farther ITM a call OR put is, the lower the risk of it relatively speaking. Far ITM calls simulate a long share position, while far ITM puts simulate a short share position. Calls or puts OTM really were never meant to be used in the way they currently are. Options in general were actually meant as a hedge, and OTM options are supposed to be used as an unlikely hedge...That's why they cost so little.\n",
      "2876 0.9712 You're operating on a faulty assumption of the premium price for a put that is already $10 in the money at the time of purchase.  If you bought 100 shares of GME at $10 and it went to $20, roughly where it's at now, your $1000 investment is now worth $2000.  If you bought a $30 put, it'd cost you about $1000 premium, a little more really, because it's already $10 in the money at $20/share.  If it went to $0 or close by expiration, yeah, you'd have the right to exercise at the strike $30, giving you a profit of $3000 - $1000 premium = $2000 total profit off the put. In a sense, you spent $1000 for the 100 shares, made $1000 on them, then paid $1000 premium for the $30 put, then sold the shares for $3000.  From start to finish, you'd be up $2000.  You'd be better off holding the 100 shares bought at $10 and gone to $20 ($1000 profit already) and then writing covered calls - it wouldn't be that long until you made $1000 off of them and then you could write one final call at a strike you know will assign and then just take your $2000 profit that way.  It's much more probable than GME going to $0.\n",
      "2877 0.0 1. You know you can edit posts right?\n",

      "2878 0.2263 A 30 put will be priced according to how deep it's in the money, which in your hypothetical is $10 ITM.  A 30 put won't cost 300 premium near expiration - it will cost 1000 because it's $10 ITM so one contract will be worth $1000.\n",

      "2892 0.9546 Sure. I can give you a hypothetical. Let's say you buy 100 shares of  GME right now for $2120, $21.20 a share. Now let's say the comfortable downside risk you're allowing yourself is $10 a share, and you're planning to long holding GME for 1+ year. You can buy a 1/21/22 17p for $755, or $7.55 a share, which would allow you to sell your shares for $17 a share on that date, effectively capping your max loss at $9.45 a share ($17-$7.55). On the other hand, let's say wsb's thesis is correct, and GME is trading at $50 a share on that date. You normally would profit $28.80 a share ($50-$21.20) but you bought that put which cost you $7.55 a share, so you reduced your profit here by $7.55 a share.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's deeper ways to hedge that are more complicated, but you can modify the level of hedge by selling puts at lower strikes. In the above example, if I'm pretty sure the price will hold above $15, but want some downside protection from the current level, I could sell a 1/22/21 15p while still buying the 1/22/21 17p which would reduce the cost of my downside protection (But also limit it; selling that 15p would reduce protection if GME fell significantly below that level)\n",

      "Brokers (like Robinhood) can frontrun your orders. This means they see your orders and buy/sell before then based on that data. Ex: WSB sets 1 mil in buys on open. So the HFs buy 2 mil in stocks BEFORE that, which raises the stock. Then, OUR 1 mil is purchased at the premium. THEN they sell off their 2 mil stocks to make a HUGE profit and crater the stock even further than it opened. So, we're literally devestating our own cause if we don't use *BUY LIMITS*.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what happened Thursday. The buy sentiment was ENORMOUS. HFs bought in first. Then Robinhood triggered the buy freeze at a critical high, devestating the stock price. Despite the blatantly open corruption, this happens ALL the time, and it's why hedge funds absolutely ruin retail investors so easily. They're handed cheat codes to steal your money with no legal ramifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "They WILL try to dip this stock, and have a lot of cheats to do so. You MUST set buy limits (not open buys) at or below the current price if you want to trigger this squeeze and prevent exploitation. Brokers can only trade at the designated buy when it hits. Even if every retail investor buys, the stock would still go DOWN if they weren't done with proper limits because the institutions controls WHEN those buys make a difference on the stock.\n",

The failure to deliver increased to about 120,000 for GME , though if you want a conspiracy the SEC hasn't released one for January. It's likely that interest went over 100% due to stock lending programs. But alas I think we have proof of neither but I wouldnt put it past wall street still naked shorting.

      "\n",
      "Reasons why I think this is wrong:\n",
      "(1) This DD doesn’t really factor in anything on business fundamentals and competition. Sure stores are getting profitable (says mgmt. mainly due to closing shittier stores) but the four wall margins on these stores are incredibly low as it begins and the cash generation of the business is de minimus. Effectively, the company generates no free cash flow and more recently this has been exacerbated. \n",
      "\n",
      "(2) This isint really a short term problem for the company. The industry is experiencing a shift and GameStop is not well positioned to compete against other online competitors, Amazon, other commoditized online marketplaces, etc. The business is battling to shift strategies and stay alive. The company has already seen operating margins decrease from 6% (already low) to negative territory and to further make my point gross margins are sub 30%! The company is on a race to restructure, gain expensive financing, buyback stock (pre covid) to keep investors happy, and cut dividends to save cash in the hope of a digital strategy. An old company trying to stay alive in “new times”. Not to mention COVID...\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Related to the long-term, even if they are successful in building an online marketplace, consumers won’t be buying games (software, which is  50% of revenues) IMO, from marketplaces or from physical locations. My view is that they will buy and download directly from the console as i) internet speeds increase ii) internet spends become cheaper and iii) or smart TVs link in a “gaming marketplace” where consumers buy/rent games... same goes for PC etc. Think what Netflix did to Blockbuster. Even Blockbuster tried to do a “Blockbuster Online” in August 2004... in September 2010 the company filed for Bankruptcy protection. Why is GameStop different? Why can they make the switch more effectively? Why do people continue to go to Brick and mortar stores vs. Purchase online? How can GameStop’s executive team truly turn around? Why do executives leave this company due to “personal reasons” (previous. CEO/CFO)...my guess is they saw the writing on the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Valuation: so what are you really paying for? 8x 20A EBITDA and +60x 20A PE... -50% FCF yield... in a company that is experiencing extreme structural headwinds and competition. Are you sufficiently compensated for the risk you are taking on in their “digital strategy” execution? I think not, but that is your decision. I guess they have $500M in cash to fund the dream for a bit, but odds are a dilutive equity financing comes or something worse. Your better of IMO buying a met coal producer at 4X EBITDA or an “actual” tech company at 15x sales. What do you really want to pay for a shitty Brick and Mortar business with low margins that has dreams to have a website... when the dust settles you can only cut so many costs and this company will be fighting for life over the next few years (if it survives)\n",

I think that the additional shares offered at earnings was supposed to be the back door to save the fuckers at Melvin from the MOASS, but then Daddy Cohen came and squashed it like the baller that he is by increasing his stake...however, shorts still haven't covered yet...and I'm convinced there's still another back door that none of us have seen.  \n",

      "\n",
      "First, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n",
      "\n",
      "Official definition:\n",
      "\n",
      "•\t⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •\t⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •\t⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dumbed down version:\n",
      "\n",
      "•\t⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •\t⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does that mean for us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n",

However, they were highly shorted and still I believed in them for many reasons.

Sadly I couldn't realize much profit from it as I had to sell at +20% or so twice or so because I was still a student back then and eventually \"needed\" the money for stuff more important than \"stupid stocks\".

Melvin Capital will not be hurt so much as the long put loss is the maximum and if GME go down. Melvin Capital will gain few X return ok investment. The short sequeeze is from GME 14 to 42. Now sure whether GME will go any further up. Also I look at Melvin Capital performance, they beat S&P 500 for last year period and they have AUM 13 billion.

      "6503 0.9289 Honestly, the part that is disappointing to me is... Melvin is going to make a fucking ton of money on this play. If you look at Melvin's 13F, their GME play is only a mere .27% of their portfolio value. Meaning that honestly, they are very likely just averaging down as this continues to go up, because in the grand scheme of things.. the position is completely irrelevant to their larger picture, and clearly GME hasn't done anything in the past week to justify doubling their market cap for the long term RIGHT NOW. Sure, we might price in the new market cap because of Cohen.. but they really need to deliver on things to justify it staying this high. And in the nearish term, I can see GME falling back down to the low 30's range maybe even mid to high 20's after other shorts without the capital of Melvin get taken out. I do believe this will still make some jumps up, but everyone needs to make their own decisions on when you've made enough money.\n",

      "/e The part that's still confusing about Melvin's position to me is.. they reported as having this position in Q4 2015. The price range in Q4 was 28.05-41.50. So lets even take the absolute worse case scenario and say they shorted at $28.05. Why would you not fully cover when the stock was at $5 or $4 or $3.5? Like are you really going to be up on the position a *minimum* of 700% but keep in the trade for that extra $3-5 of value per share? Like you're up a minimum of $120M, you're actually going to sit around and wait for that extra $15-20 million by the company going bankrupt? I feel like i'm missing something with how they managed that trade, from what we are able to see through 13F's.\n",

So the inflows, bull orders and dark pools are just ways for institutions to try to mask how they buy shares, and you can track it by matching the orders to the t&s tape ticker? Then, correct me if I’m wrong, you’re saying that basically institutions went short on millions of shares of GME, making their buddies who write these shares happy. The actual shares that are transactable however are much much less, meaning there’s basically a hidden lower supply? Like if volume is 50m and there’s 10m outstanding but we see 60m because of shorted shares, that would drive the price up like crazy wouldn’t it? I think I get what you’re talking about. Then Why wouldn’t they do as you say? Buy deep OTM 7 DTE options, liquidate their shorts, increase actual outstanding shares but skyrocket the price due to the buying. Day trade it for a couple 10 baggers in profit and walk away broken even or even profiting? It looks like they are genuinely short this company and yeah they’re manipulating but that’s to combat their losses.\n",

Question is whether one of the large players (not APPL) would intervene and take over GME just to give them a few percentage edge on uptake of their particular platform, since $1B is pocket lint for them compared to the value of becoming the Oasis of the future, in a way to ante up against Apple with their Apple stores. The bought GME stores can be a combination of a Genius Bar repair/upgrade shop, showroom, and in-person live competition hub. The stores can run as a loss leader, similar to how Google pretty much gives away a Chromebook hardware to make money on services. MSFT would be my best guess as to who would buy GME, though they exited their retail stores a while back. The value of buying GME vs just starting your own stores is because it is the cutthroat solution, since it takes away the network that is currently selling your competitors products as well as your own. MSFT does this with video game software studios, not only to release their own, but to stop them to releasing them for other platforms.\n",

I noticed is that your net margin is much healthier than those forecasts imply - specifically your SG&A forecasts seem low to me. Across the 3 cases you’re forecasting 16-17% of revenue for SG&A whereas I can’t find a historical quarter where GameStop has kept that figure below 20%. Is this because you believe the console sales don’t require the same marketing spend (ie you’re not spending much because the demand is enough to draw customers)? Or does this have something to do with a larger e-commerce mix? I’d love to hear your feedback on this!\n",
